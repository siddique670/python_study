## Symbol                 Operation
#  +                      add
#  -                     subtract
#  *                     multiply
#  /                     divide
#  **                    exponentiate
#  %                     modulo

######## exponent
# exa:- of exponentiate  2**2, it mean 2" raise to power of 4
# 2*2*2*2 = 16

### Modulo Operator ###
# 3%2 = 1 (1 is reminder)
# 4%2 = 0 

# sum = 1 + 2
# difference = 100 - 1
# new_number = sum + difference
# print(new_number)
# print(sum / sum)
# print(sum + 1)

# pi = 3.15
# radius = 5
# area = (pi - radius) * 400
# print(area)
